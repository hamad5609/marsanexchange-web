PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY, AS IT INVOLVES A WAIVER OF CERTAIN RIGHTS TO 
BRING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING AS A CLASS ACTION.
1. Notice of Claim and Dispute Resolution Period. Please contact Marsan Exchange first!
Marsan Exchange wants to address your concerns without resorting to formal legal 
proceedings, if possible. If you have a dispute with Marsan Exchange, then you should contact 
Marsan Exchange and a ticket number will be assigned. Marsan Exchange will attempt to 
resolve your dispute internally as soon as possible. The parties agree to negotiate in good faith 
to resolve the dispute (which discussions shall remain confidential and be subject to applicable 
rules protecting settlement discussions from use as evidence in any legal proceeding).
In the event the dispute cannot be resolved satisfactorily, and you wish to assert a legal claim 
against Marsan Exchange, then you agree to set forth the basis of such claim in writing in a 
“Notice of Claim,” as a form of prior notice to Marsan Exchange. The Notice of Claim must (1) 
describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, (2) set forth the specific relief sought, (3) 
provide the original ticket number, and (4) include your Marsan Exchange account email. The 
Notice of Claim should be submitted to an email address or hyperlink provided in your 
correspondence with Marsan Exchange. After you have provided the Notice of Claim to Marsan 
Exchange, the dispute referenced in the Notice of Claim may be submitted by either Marsan 
Exchange or you to arbitration in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Section, below. For the 
avoidance of doubt, the submission of a dispute to Marsan Exchange for resolution internally 
and the delivery of a Notice of Claim to Marsan Exchange are prerequisites to commencement 
of an arbitration proceeding (or any other legal proceeding). During the arbitration, the 
amount of any settlement offer made by you or Marsan Exchange shall not be disclosed to the 
arbitrator.
2. Agreement to Arbitrate. You and Marsan Exchange agree that, subject to paragraph 1 
above, any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Marsan Exchange arising in 
connection with or relating in any way to these Terms or to your relationship with Marsan 
Exchange as a user of Marsan Exchange Services (whether based in contract, tort, statute, 
fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or 
after the termination of these Terms) will be determined by mandatory final and binding 
individual (not class) arbitration, except as set forth below under Exceptions to Agreement to 
Arbitrate. You and Marsan Exchange further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive 
power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including without limitation any objections with 
respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Agreement to Arbitrate, or to the arbitrability 
of any claim or counterclaim. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. THERE IS NO 
JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS 
LIMITED. There may be more limited discovery than in court. The arbitrator must follow this 
agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including, if applicable, 
attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award declaratory or injunctive relief 
benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration. The arbitration provisions set forth in this 
Section will survive termination of these Terms. Arbitration Rules. The arbitration shall be 
subject to the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (the “ICC”) then 
in force (the “ICC Rules”), as modified by this Section X. The arbitration will be administered by 
the International Court of Arbitration of the ICC. Unless the parties agree otherwise, there shall 
be only one arbitrator appointed in accordance with the ICC Rules. Any arbitration will be 
conducted in the English language, unless otherwise required by a mandatory law of a member 
state of the European Union or any other jurisdiction. Regardless of the manner in which the 
arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to 
explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are 
based.
JUDGMENT ON ANY ARBITRAL AWARD MAY BE GIVEN IN ANY COURT HAVING 
JURISDICTION OVER THE PARTY (OR OVER THE ASSETS OF THE PARTY) 
AGAINST WHOM SUCH AN AWARD IS RENDERED. TIME FOR FILING: ANY 
ARBITRATION AGAINST MARSAN EXCHANGE MUST BE COMMENCED BY FILING 
A REQUEST FOR ARBITRATION WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR, AFTER THE DATE THE 
PARTY ASSERTING THE CLAIM FIRST KNOWS OR REASONABLY SHOULD KNOW 
OF THE ACT, OMISSION OR DEFAULT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM; AND THERE 
SHALL BE NO RIGHT TO ANY REMEDY FOR ANY CLAIM NOT ASSERTED WITHIN 
THAT TIME PERIOD. THIS ONE YEAR LIMITATION PERIOD IS INCLUSIVE OF 
THE INTERNAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURE SET FORTH IN 
PARAGRAPH 1 OF THIS SECTION, ABOVE. THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT TO ANY 
REMEDY FOR ANY CLAIM NOT ASSERTED WITHIN THAT TIME PERIOD.
If applicable law prohibits a one-year limitation period for asserting claims, any claim must be 
asserted within the shortest time period permitted by applicable law. Process; Notice: The 
party who intends to seek arbitration after the expiration of the Dispute Resolution Period set 
forth in paragraph 1, above, must submit a request to the ICC in accordance with the ICC Rules. 
If we request arbitration against you, we will give you notice at the email address or mailing 
address you have provided. You agree that any notice sent to this email or mailing address shall 
be deemed effective for all purposes, including without limitation to determinations of 
adequacy of service. It is your obligation to ensure that the email address and/or mailing 
address on file with Marsan Exchange is up-to-date and accurate. Seat of Arbitration: The seat 
of the arbitration shall be Montreal. Place of Hearing: The location of any in-person arbitration 
hearing shall be Montreal, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. Governing Law / 
Jurisdiction: The governing law of the arbitration shall be determined in accordance with the 
ICC Rules. Confidentiality. The parties agree that the arbitration shall be kept confidential. The 
existence of the arbitration, any nonpublic information provided in the arbitration, and any 
submissions, orders or awards made in the arbitration (together, the “Confidential 
Information”) shall not be disclosed to any non-party except the tribunal, the ICC, the parties, 
their counsel, experts, witnesses, accountants and auditors, insurers and reinsurers, and any 
other person necessary to the conduct of the arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a 
party may disclose Confidential Information to the extent that disclosure may be required to 
fulfill a legal duty, protect or pursue a legal right, or enforce or challenge an award in bona fide 
legal proceedings. This confidentiality provision shall survive termination of these Terms and 
of any arbitration brought pursuant to these Terms.
3. Class Action Waiver. You and Marsan Exchange agree that any claims relating to these 
Terms or to your relationship with Marsan Exchange as a user of Marsan Exchange Services 
(whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, 
and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms) shall be brought 
against the other party in an arbitration on an individual basis only and not as a plaintiff or 
class member in a purported class or representative action. You and Marsan Exchange further 
agree to waive any right for such claims to be brought, heard, or arbitrated as a class, collective, 
representative, or private attorney general action, to the extent permissible by applicable law. 
Combining or consolidating individual arbitrations into a single arbitration is not permitted 
without the consent of all parties, including Marsan Exchange.
4. Modifications. Marsan Exchange reserves the right to update, modify, revise, suspend, or 
make any future changes to Section X regarding the parties’ Agreement to Arbitrate, subject to 
applicable law. You hereby consent and agree that it is your responsibility to ensure that your

your Marsan Exchange account shall be deemed to be your acceptance of any modifications to 
Section X regarding the parties’ Agreement to Arbitrate. You agree that if you object to the 
modifications to Section X, Marsan Exchange may block access to your account pending closure 
of your account. In such circumstances, the Terms of Use prior to modification shall remain in 
full force and effect pending closure of your account.

party’s right to require performance at any time thereafter. At the same time, the waiver of one
